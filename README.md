A 7-day interaction design challenge showcasing creative UI components and animations. Each day features a unique interactive element designed to push the boundaries of user experience and visual design.

## 🎯 Challenge Overview

This project is part of the [Peerlist Interaction Design Challenge](https://peerlist.io/challenges/interaction-design-challenge-aug25), where I'm creating one interactive component each day for 7 days.

## 📅 Daily Challenges

### Day 1: Animated Avatar Stack
- **Focus**: Creative avatar stacking with hover interactions
- **Features**: Smooth animations, focus effects, and elegant transitions
- **Interaction**: Hover on any avatar to center it and reveal the person's name

### Day 2: Interactive OTP Input
- **Focus**: Enhanced verification input with visual feedback
- **Features**: Bouncy animations, sound design, and clear state management
- **Interaction**: Type the code `069420` to see success animations
- **Audio**: Subtle sound feedback for typing and verification

### Days 3-7: Coming Soon
More exciting interactive components are on the way!

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Audio**: Web Audio API
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety
- **UI Components**: Custom components with shadcn/ui foundation

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Minimal**: Clean, focused design without unnecessary elements
- **Interactive**: Every component responds to user interaction
- **Polished**: Attention to micro-interactions and details
- **Accessible**: Built with accessibility in mind
